# Shopify Labels

This is a very basic app for loading a CSV file of orders exported from Shopify, and generate pages suitable for printing address labels.

At the moment itâ€™s hardcoded to suit my needs, which are three column A4 pages with eleven rows of labels. I might make it more customizable in the future, especially since print CSS is quirky and label printing needs some precision/fiddling.

No files are sent to the server, this is just a one page html/javascript app.
